strongly typed

functions

"comptime" execution
enums

modules, rust-like

syntax: c-like ?
simple syntax
macros ?

"any" type, but discouraged ?
void type


later: modes of "compilation" that can be detected by the code
ideally: can be used for "low" and "high" level coding


usage for web ?


```
let variable: Number = 10;
variable += 10;

struct Person {
	name: String,
	age: Number,
	children: Child[]
}

impl Person {
	fn speak() {
		log("hi!");
	}
}

let john = Person {
	name: "john",
	age: 30,
	children: []
};
